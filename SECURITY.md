# Security Policy

I do not guarantee the security of this workflow.
It is just a personal hobby and experiment right now.
Do not use this workflow for sensitive codebases without extensive security review.

That said, security reports are welcome here and I, Neill, will do my best to monitor and respond to whatever matters arise.
Simply open an issue on this repository or, if you are uncomfortable discussing the vulnerability in a public setting, email me at the address associated with my GitHub account.

A few disclaimers:

* I make no guarantees on the efficiency of either my first response or ultimate action taken addressing any reports that come my way.

* I offer no standard compensation for security reports, no matter how severe. Any reward extended will be based entirely on personal whims and should not be interpreted as a pattern.
